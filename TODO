1 multi-client ability: which tun device to use, etc.

2 register which users have been added to iptables and just remove those
  on 'stop' instead of looking them up anew? That would ease the issue
  with groups changing between start and stop.

3 across a sleep cycle, or host interface going down and up, my Debian
  installation leads to openvpn entering a loop (by way of interfacing
  taking down routes I guess)

4 status stuff is complex, and already more than necessary: should
  eliminate 'daemon' variable and instead always take daemonize --status,
  right?

5 When the daemon variable, which should really be renamed to wantvpn
  or something, is 'on', restart the connection if either client or
  server daemon is down. (Check server using ssh, after disabling the
  vpn? Or, add exception to tunneling for ssh connections to the
  server?)

6 document that when changing the configuration, 'stop' has to be
  issued before saving the new configuration; do that differently? 
  *search* for running instances?
