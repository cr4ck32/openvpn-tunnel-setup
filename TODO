* could use daemonize --stop, *iff* I don't look up and feed it the
  client ip anymore; which would be fine since it would save the ssh
  call for that lookup. But, maybe there are some circumstances where
  the client ip is really needed? (server NATed instead of the client)?
  Also, to differentiate daemonize invocations for multiple clients,
  it would still need some id for the client (hostname? But how to include
  in daemonize, add a flag to the latter?). But, even then, there's more
  to it for multi-client ability: which tun device to use, for example?

* register which users have been added to iptables and just remove those
  on 'stop' instead of looking them up anew? That would ease the issue
  with groups changing between start and stop.
