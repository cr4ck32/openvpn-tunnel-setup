1 multi-client ability: which tun device to use, etc.

2 register which users have been added to iptables and just remove those
  on 'stop' instead of looking them up anew? That would ease the issue
  with groups changing between start and stop.

  installation leads to openvpn entering a loop (by way of interfacing
  taking down routes I guess)
