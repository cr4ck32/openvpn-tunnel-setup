* Relatively often, I'm getting sudden periods where the UDP packets
  from openvpn aren't reaching the server, as can be confirmed by
  running tcpdump on the server. This then sorts itself out all by
  itself after 10-15 minutes or after the client going to sleep some
  time. It seems to usually happen soon after restarting the tunnel,
  thereafter the tunnel seems to be more stable; or maybe it's after
  periods of heavy traffic. I haven't figured out yet whether this
  is simply my ISP dropping them during these periods or whether
  there is something else going on. Tcpdump reports the packets as
  leaving the client through the interface towards the ISP, so that
  would hint that it's the ISP, but maybe they are killed by the
  kernel after tcpdump sees them?

  -> it seems increasingly clear to me that this is really my ISP
  (T-Mobile UK) simply dropping the packets. It seems that they are
  running a packet pattern analyzer that is looking for tunneled Skype
  or VoIP traffic and is killing the connection when triggered.

* stop and start are a bit slow because of the several remote ssh
  calls. Using stoprouting and startrouting as much as possible is a
  fast workaround, though.
