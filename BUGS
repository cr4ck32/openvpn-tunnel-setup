* (is this obsolete now that also meta traffic is going through the VPN?)
  Relatively often, I'm getting sudden periods where the UDP packets
  from openvpn aren't reaching the server, as can be confirmed by
  running tcpdump on the server. This then sorts itself out all by
  itself after 10-15 minutes or after the client going to sleep some
  time. It seems to usually happen soon after restarting the tunnel,
  thereafter the tunnel seems to be more stable; or maybe it's after
  periods of heavy traffic. I haven't figured out yet whether this
  is simply my ISP dropping them during these periods or whether
  there is something else going on. Tcpdump reports the packets as
  leaving the client through the interface towards the ISP, so that
  would hint that it's the ISP, but maybe they are killed by the
  kernel after tcpdump sees them?

* stop and start are a bit slow because of the several remote ssh
  calls. Using stoprouting and startrouting as much as possible is a
  fast workaround, though.

* network manager happily overwrites our /etc/resolv.conf.vpn-tunnel_ours_*
  through the /etc/resolv.conf symlink if status is on while network
  manager does some action. (Maybe it's even the dhcp daemon?)
  Sigh.
  This also means that 'vpn-tunnel status' is somewhat dubious.
  (It'll still be correct in that it will reflect the status of the
  last upping or downing action.)
